# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict the number of bike-sharing users based on various factors like weather conditions, season, temperature, and time of day. By creating an accurate predictive model, we can help optimize the allocation of bikes at different locations, ensuring that the demand for bikes is met efficiently.

## Business Problem

Bike-sharing systems are becoming increasingly popular, offering a flexible and environmentally friendly alternative for urban transportation. One of the main challenges in these systems is ensuring the optimal availability of bikes at each station, especially during peak hours. Predicting the demand for bikes based on weather, time, and season will help operators efficiently allocate bikes and reduce customer dissatisfaction due to bike shortages.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting the number of bike-sharing users for a given day and time based on historical data. This model will help operators better manage bike distribution and meet customer demand, especially during high-demand periods.

## Data Understanding

The dataset used for this project comes from a bike-sharing system and contains the following columns:

dteday: Date of observation
season: Season (1: winter, 2: spring, 3: summer, 4: fall)
weathersit: Weather situation (1: Clear, 2: Mist, 3: Light Snow/Rain, 4: Heavy Rain)
temp: Normalized temperature in Celsius
atemp: Normalized "feels-like" temperature in Celsius
hum: Normalized humidity
hr: Hour of the day (0-23)
casual: Number of casual users (not registered)
registered: Number of registered users
cnt: Total count of users (target variable)
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using the following steps:

Handling Missing Values: Checked for missing data and found none.
Outliers: Outliers in the casual, registered, and cnt columns were detected but were retained as they represent natural variations in user behavior.
Feature Engineering: Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical features like season, weathersit, and holiday to convert them into numerical format.
Normalization: Numerical features such as temp, atemp, and hum were normalized using StandardScaler to ensure that the model can learn effectively.
Modeling

## Three machine learning models were used to predict bike-sharing demand:

Linear Regression: A simple model to capture linear relationships between features and the target variable (cnt).
XGBoost: A powerful boosting algorithm used to capture complex patterns in the data.
Random Forest: An ensemble model of decision trees that provides a good balance between bias and variance.
Evaluation Metrics

## We used the following metrics to evaluate the performance of our models:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Provides a more interpretable version of MSE in the original units of the target variable.
R-squared (R²): Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Model Results
Linear Regression: RMSE = 2.90e-13, R² = 1.0
XGBoost: RMSE = 4.27, R² = 0.9994
Random Forest: RMSE = 3.08, R² = 0.9997
The Random Forest model performed the best, with an R² of 0.9997, meaning that it explains almost all the variability in the data.

## Learning Curves

Learning curves were generated for both XGBoost and Random Forest models to check for overfitting or underfitting. Both models showed a close relationship between training and validation scores, indicating that they generalize well without overfitting the data.

## Conclusion

The Random Forest model is the most suitable for this task due to its high accuracy and ability to handle complex relationships in the data. With this model, we can predict bike demand very accurately, which will be highly beneficial for operators in managing bike allocation during high-demand periods.

## Recommendations

Implementation: The Random Forest model can be deployed in real-time bike-sharing systems to predict user demand and ensure efficient bike availability.
Future Improvements: Adding more external factors, such as local events or traffic conditions, could improve the model’s predictive performance.
Limitations: The model’s performance is reliant on historical patterns. It may not perform well in situations with sudden changes, such as new policies or drastic changes in the weather.
